    "\n",
    "Incident response is what happens after a security breach, and not surprisingly is a growing sector of the information security business.  Mandiant is a leading incident response company and has resolved many breaches including:  Equifax, the Clinton Campaign, and Target.  They report that **attackers in the U.S. go undetected for more than 3 months on average**.  During this time attackers need to maintain a presence inside the compromised network and to ship data out.  All this traffic must go through whatever protections the organization has in place.  My project focuses on detecting these signals before the objective of the attack is obtained.  \n",

    "[Security Onion](https://securityonion.net) is a distribution of Linux focused on network monitoring.  Developed and maintained by the incident responders at Mandiant, SO includes tools to gather and analyze network traffic, and one in particular - [Bro Security Network Monitor (BSNM)](https://www.bro.org/) - is perfect for feature engineering.  BSNM understands network protocols and produces log files for each. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was unable to find a set of labeled data to use for this project.  So, I decided to gather data from my own home network, and use it to represent normal data.  After a couple of weeks, I now have ~40,000 DNS and ~80,000 connection log entries.  Beyond simply logging the traffic SO gives you means to investigate events using both beohavior-based ([BSNM](https://www.bro.org/)) and signature-based ([Snort](https://www.snort.org/)) detection tools.  Investigating my own network, I found one computer that appeared to have malware and have since wiped and re-imaged the system.  Now that my network appears to be free of malware, I think my plan to label its DNS traffic normal is reasonable.  \n",

His [talk at Security Onion Con 2016](https://youtu.be/ViR405l-ggg) and his [related blog post](http://www.ericconrad.com/2016/09/c2-phone-home-leveraging-securityonion.html) includes links to BSNM logs for four different malicious uses of DNS including both tunneling and C2 communications and contain ~6,500 DNS and ~3,500 connection log entries.

    "* Why the focus on DNS: DNS answers the question of what IP address has been assigned to a URL.  By design, if a query can't answered locally it is forwarded to the root server for that top-level domain, and then recursively on down to an authoritative server.  DNS is an essential service for any organization and is rarely monitored. Even from deep within a organizations network most systems have DNS access and the forwarding behavior of this protocol enables DNS packets to reach the internet.  Just as the DNS response packets are let back in. This makes it a perfect communication channel for attackers.    \n",

    "Blacklisting and whitelisting are core practices to security and IT practitioners.  The idea goes back to firewalls which must either pass a packet or block it.

By evaluating my project in comparison to a blacklist/whitelist approach, I hope to make its results accessible to professionals in an industry where I hope to be hired.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we apply the blacklist / whitelist idea to DNS attack traffic?  If the security team at an organization uses a blacklist approach where they maintain a list of blocked URLs. In so doing, they give the attacker the advantage by allowing them to make small changes to domain names they use to avoid having their traffic from being blocked.  Whitelists on the other hand also disadvantage the security team because in addition to finding the malicious traffic, they also produce a lot of false positives.  Security teams tend to be lean because they are overhead expense to the organization that makes the impact of a whitelist approach is all the more.\n",
